# 📚 Machine Learning Plagiarism Detector

Plagiarism detection is important in educational and professional environments. This project illustrates how one can build an effective plagiarism detector using machine learning and host it through an easy-to-use Flask web application.

## 🔍 Introduction

Using machine learning techniques, we can design a smart system that can identify copied content. This project walks you through all of it — dataset preparation until you develop a full-stack web application that can identify plagiarism within seconds.

## 📊 Collecting the Dataset

The foundation of any ML project is quality data. In this detector here, what we have is a dataset of text samples — each one is tagged as either **plagiarized** or **original**.

You can:
- Use real-world datasets from datasets such as **Kaggle**
- Or develop your own sets of original and translated documents to train on

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing the Data

Before model training, the text is preprocessed:

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all words into lowercase
- **Removal of Punctuation**: Deleting unwanted characters
- **Removal of stopwords**: Elimination of filler words (e.g., "the", "is")

---

## 🤖 Building the ML Model

We transform the preprocessed text into a numerical representation using **TF-IDF vectorization**. We then train a **Logistic Regression model**, which learns to classify a given input as plagiarized or not.

Model artifacts:
- `model.pkl`: Trained ML model
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF transformer

---

## 🌐Constructing the Flask Web Application

To offer an interface for this tool, we developed a web interface using **Flask:**

- 💬They feed a sample of text
- 🚀 Backend loads the trained model and vectorizer
- 📈 Predicts and provides output:
- ✅ No Plagiarism Detected
- ❌ Plagiarism Detected

## 🖼️ Web Interface

```bash
📁 /templates/index.html
The front-end is a basic HTML form for user input. You can style this UI pretty with Bootstrap or Tailwind to your liking.

🧠 Future Enhancements
📌Identify individual plagiarized text segments

🧠Use deep learning (e.g., BERT) for better accuracy
